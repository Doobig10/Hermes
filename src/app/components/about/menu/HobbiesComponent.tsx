            <p>
                In my downtime I have been known to enjoy a variety of video games, leading to a fascination with modding and
                game related development which prompted much of my early learning in languages such as Lua and C#. This
                interest continually exposes me to new languages, environments and approaches which all contribute to my
                personal development and skill set. It has also led to me being familiar with many different file structures such
                as JSON, XML, YAML and others which I can now read and use with a level of competency.
            </p><br />

                Additionally, I have also developed an interest in the development and operation of game servers, leading to greater
                familiarity with tools such as Docker, prompting me to learn about how they can be used to deploy simple streamlined
                game servers and by extension, products in general.
